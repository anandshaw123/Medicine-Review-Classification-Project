## ‚ùì***Problem***:

**To analyze patient reviews of medicines to evaluate their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement, helping pharmaceutical companies enhance their products and develop better combinations.**



## üéØ***Objectives:***

The objectives for analyzing patient reviews of medicines include understanding patient sentiment by classifying reviews into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral to gauge overall satisfaction. Also aim to evaluate the effectiveness of medicines by identifying trends and correlations between user feedback and specific medicines. Another objective is to pinpoint areas of improvement by recognizing common issues, complaints, or reported side effects. The analysis should provide actionable insights for pharmaceutical companies to enhance current products and develop new combinations tailored to patient needs. Additionally, it should support informed decision-making by highlighting key areas for focus and enabling predictive analysis to anticipate trends and future concerns based on existing data.
